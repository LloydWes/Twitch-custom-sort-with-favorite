# Twitch-custom-sort-with-favorite
This script is an adaptation of the [twitch-sort-by-viewcount](https://github.com/tomasz13nocon/twitch-sort-by-viewcount) but you can change the sorting mode (viewer count or alphabetical) and add favorites that stays to the top of the list.
At the beginning it was as a quick and dirty script to have "favorites" but now it's just dirty

You can change the sort viewer count/alphabetical by clicking  "Followed Channel"
